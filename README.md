# CGFX_Viewer_SharpDX  
  
This tool is the SharpDX version of [CGFX_Viewer].  
This tool is my own personal creation to understand the structure of BCMDL files and for learning purposes.  
This tool is still a work in progress, but will eventually be able to read and write files.  
We don't know when it will be completed, as we are prioritizing our real-life plans, but it would be very helpful if you could sit back with a cup of coffee and watch it quietly.  
  
・HLSL Shader should be excluded from the project build (*.hlsl shader should be compiled directly [psCGFXMaterial.hlsl][vsCGFXMaterial])  
・Please make sure that all *.hlsl files are HLSL Shader 4.0 before building the HLSL shaders.
